        <h4>Photo of Roasted Garlic Lemon Broccoli</h4>
        <p>I decided to give lemon roasted broccoli a try when I was looking for a unique way 
            to prepare broccoli. Florets are roasted after being tossed in olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt, 
            freshly ground black pepper, and minced garlic. 
            A squeeze of lemon juice before serving seals the deal.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 heads broccoli, separated into florets</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Â½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li> 
            <li>Toss broccoli florets with extra virgin olive oil, sea salt, 
                pepper, and garlic in a large bowl. Spread the broccoli out 
                in an even layer on a baking sheet.
            </li> 
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until florets are tender enough to pierce the
                stems with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. 
                Remove and transfer to a serving platter.</li>
            <li>Squeeze lemon juice liberally over broccoli before serving for a refreshing, tangy finish.</li>
        </ol>
